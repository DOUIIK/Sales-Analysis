# Sales Analysis Project

This project analyzes sales data for a 12-month period to uncover trends and insights that can help inform business decisions. The dataset includes records of product sales, order dates, quantities, prices, and purchase locations across multiple cities. The analysis explores several key areas to identify the best month for sales, the most successful cities, peak purchase times, frequently sold product combinations, and top-selling products.

## Key Features

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: 
   - Consolidated 12 months of sales data into a single file.
   - Handled missing and erroneous data by removing NaN rows and correcting formatting issues.
   - Added new columns like month and city to facilitate further analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - **Best Month for Sales**: Identified which month generated the highest sales and visualized the results using a bar chart.
   - **Top Cities for Sales**: Grouped data by city to determine which locations sold the most products.
   - **Best Time for Advertisements**: Analyzed sales by hour to find the optimal time for advertising.
   - **Frequently Sold Product Combinations**: Used order IDs to find products that are frequently bought together.
   - **Top-Selling Products**: Determined the product with the highest sales volume and explored possible reasons behind its popularity.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created bar charts and line plots to represent sales trends over time, across cities, and by product categories.
   - Dual-axis plots were used to compare product quantities sold with their average prices.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis (using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn).
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning, merging, and grouping.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into sales performance over the year, helping to inform future business strategies and marketing efforts.
